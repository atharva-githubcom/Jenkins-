 ✅ What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool** used for building, testing, and deploying software automatically.
It helps developers in **Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).
Written in **Java**, and accessible via a web interface.

🎯 Uses of Jenkins (Why It's Used)

* Automate code building and testing.
* Continuously integrate changes from multiple developers.
* Auto-deploy applications to staging/production.
* Schedule regular jobs (backups, script execution).
* Easily connect with tools like Git, Maven, Docker, AWS, etc.

🚀 **Advantages of Jenkins**

| Benefit               | Explanation                                                    |

## 🧩 **Important Modules / Architecture Components**

| Component              | Explanation                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Jenkins Master**     | Main controller, manages jobs and agents.                    |
| **Jenkins Agent/Node** | Executes the jobs. Can be on another machine.                |
| **Executor**           | A thread that runs on an agent to execute one job at a time. |
| **Job (or Project)**   | A task to run (e.g., compile code).                          |
| **Build**              | A single run of a job.                                       |
| **Pipeline**           | Defines CI/CD process in code (Jenkinsfile).                 |
| **Jenkinsfile**        | Script that defines steps like build, test, deploy.          |
| **Plugins**            | Add features or integrations (e.g., Git, Docker, JIRA).      |



## 🛠️ **Key Jenkins Parameters for Interview**

| Term                             | What It Means                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Pipeline**                     | Scripted CI/CD flow (can be Declarative or Scripted).  |
| **SCM (Source Code Management)** | Tool like Git used to fetch code.                      |
| **Trigger**                      | Auto-start a job on push, schedule, webhook, etc.      |
| **Workspace**                    | Folder where Jenkins keeps files for a job.            |
| **Artifacts**                    | Output files generated by a build.                     |
| **Stages**                       | Steps inside a pipeline (e.g., Build → Test → Deploy). |
| **Declarative Pipeline**         | Easy-to-read pipeline syntax.                          |
| **Scripted Pipeline**            | Advanced, uses full Groovy scripting.                  |
| **Environment Variables**        | Used to pass dynamic values inside pipelines.          |
